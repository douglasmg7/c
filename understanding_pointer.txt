When a c programming is compiled, it works with three types of memory.
    Static / Global
    Automatic / Stack
    Dynamic / Heap

Static
    Statically declared variables are allocated to this type of memory.
    Global variables also use this region of memory.
    They are allocated when the program starts and remain in existence until the program finish.
    While all function have access to global variablesr, the scope of static variables is restricted to their defining function.

Automatic
    These variables are declared within function and are created when a function is called.
    Their scope is restricted to the function, and their lifetime is limited to the time the function is executing.
    
Dynamic
    Memory is allocated from the heap and can be released as necessary. A pointer references the allocated memory.
    The scope is limited to the pointer or pointers that refence the memory.
    It exists until it is released.
